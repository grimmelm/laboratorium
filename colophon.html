<p>The Laboratorium for Research in Experimental Aesthetics was founded in 2000 for cultural commentary, critical thought, and the creative use of computers.</p>

<p>The current iteration of the site is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Previous iterations ran on a homebrew XML-based system (2000–02), a customized version of <a href="http://www.twiki.org">Twiki</a> (2002–03), <a href="https://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> (2003–14), and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (2015-22). The current site archives posts dating back to 2015. The archives from 2000 through 2014 can be found <a href="http://laboratorium.net/archive/2014_12">here</a>, along with a few earlier essays previously reprinted on the blog.</p>

<p>The theme is a slightly tweaked version of <a href="http://bringhurst.tumblr.com">Bringhurst</a> by <a href="http://www.natashaisneat.com">Natasha Maria Fernandez-Fountain</a>, which is based on the formatting and recommendations of Robert Bringhurst’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Version-Anniversary/dp/0881792128/">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>. The typeface is Barry Schwartz&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy">Sorts Mill Goudy</a>, a revival of Frederick Goudy&rsquo;s eponymous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goudy_Old_Style">Old Style</a>. I compose my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> using <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and <a href="https://nova.app">Nova</a>.</p>
