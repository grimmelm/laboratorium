> The road to _Zork_ began in late May of 1977, when Dave Lebling put together a very simple parser and game engine quite similar to _Adventure_’s, from which Marc Blank and Tim Anderson built their first four-room game as a sort of proof of concept. … The name itself was a nonsense word floating around MIT that one might use in place of something, shall we say, stronger in stressful situation: “Zork the bloody thing!” when a piece of code just wouldn’t work correctly, etc. The file holding the game-in-progress got named “Zork” as a sort of placeholder until someone came up with something better. In the case of _Zork_, though, a proper name was slow in coming. And so _Zork_ the game remained for the first six months of its existence. …

> At some point around the fall of 1977, the DMG hackers had decided that their creation really, really needed a “proper” name. Lebling suggested _Dungeon_, which excited no one (Lebling included), but no one could come up with anything better. And so _Dungeon_ it was. … Shortly after _that_, MIT heard legal rumblings from, of all places, TSR, publishers of _Dungeons and Dragons_ – and of a dungeon-crawling board game called simply _Dungeon!_ TSR was always overzealous with lawsuits, and the consensus amongst the MIT lawyers that the DMG hackers consulted was that they didn’t have a legal leg to stand on. However, rather than get sucked into a lengthy squabble over a name none of them much liked in the first place, they decided to just revert to the much more memorable _Zork_. And so by the beginning of 1978 _Dungeon_ became _Zork_ once more, and retained that name forevermore.
