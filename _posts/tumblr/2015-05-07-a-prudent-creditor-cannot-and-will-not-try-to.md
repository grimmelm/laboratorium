title: A prudent creditor … cannot, and will not try to, protect himself against all
  the risks to which he subjected himself by making the loan; he accepts as invetable
  what may be called the business risks inherent in the situation – the risk that
  the barber shop will go broke as young men suddently decide to let their hair grow
  long, like their ancestors, or the risk that the bottom will fall out of the real
  estate market as people conclude that it is more pleasant to live in the sea, like
  their ancestors.
