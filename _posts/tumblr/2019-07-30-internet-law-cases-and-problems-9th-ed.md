It includes a new section on platforms as marketplaces, a half-dozen new cases, and updated notes, questions, and problems throughout. As always, the book can be [downloaded directly](https://www.semaphorepress.com/InternetLaw_overview.html) from Semaphore Press as a pay-what-you-want DRM-free PDF. The suggested price to students remains $30.
