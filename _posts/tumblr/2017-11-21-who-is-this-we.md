> But hold up for a minute: Who is this “we” that’s always turning up in critical writing anyway? _We_ is an escape hatch. _We_ is cheap. _We_ is a way of simultaneously sloughing off personal responsibility and taking on the mantle of easy authority. It’s the voice of the middle-brow male critic, the one who truly believes he knows how everyone else should think. _We_ is corrupt. _We_ is make-believe.
