title: In my opinion, any teenager enthralled by computers, fascinated by the ins
  and outs of computer security, and attracted by the lure of specialized forms of
  knowledge and power, would do well to forget all about hacking and set his (or her)
  sights on becoming a fed. Feds can trump hackers at almost every single thing hackers
  do, including gathering intelligence, undercover disguise, trashing, phone-tapping,
  building dossiers, networking, and infiltrating computer systems–criminal computer
  systems. Secret Service agents know more about phreaking, coding, and carding than
  most phreaks can find out in years, and when it comes to viruses, break-ins, software
  bombs, and Trojan horses, feds have direct access to red-hot confidential information
  that is only vauge rumor in the underground.
