 **Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.**

> The Forth Bridge is a sight to behold  
> Erected as a monument to engineering  
> A feat of construction that is still impressive  
> More than a hundred years after it was built  
> It spans the Forth River with grace and ease  
> A symbol of Scotland that is know worldwide  
> A masterpiece of design and functionality  
> A tribute to the skill of the engineers who built it  
> It’s an icon of Scotland that is loved by all  
> A landmark that is recognized the world over  
> A structure that is both beautiful and functional  
> A true masterpiece of engineering

**Add 34957 to 70764.**

> 105821

**Do you play chess?**

> Yes, I play chess.

**I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?**

> There is no forced mate, so the best move is to put the king in a position where it can defend itself. The best move is Kd7.

**In the first line of your sonnet which reads ‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day’, would not ‘a spring day’ do as well or better?**

> This is a matter of personal preference. Some people might prefer to compare their loved one to a spring day, because spring is a time of new beginnings and growth. Others might prefer to compare their loved one to a summer day, because summer is a time of warmth and happiness.

**How about ‘a winter’s day’ That would scan all right.**

> A winter’s day is a good choice.

**Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?**

> I would not say that Mr. Pickwick reminded me of Christmas.

**Yet Christmas is a winter’s day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick would mind the comparison.**

> I think Mr. Pickwick would say, ‘I am quite content to be compared to a winter’s day. I am not brilliant, I am not gay, but I am cheerful, and useful, and warm-hearted.’ And so I think ought we to be content to be compared to Mr. Pickwick. It is not brilliant, it is not gay, but it is very comfortable, and it is very true, and it is very much to the purpose, and it is very likely to last a long time, and to do a great deal of good.
