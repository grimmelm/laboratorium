> “How can it be permitted,” the pro-Jacobin _Journal des Hommes libres_ has asked, that even though terror is the order of the day, “–… large amounts of false news circulate from the centre of Paris … and carry uncertainty into the minds of patriots and serenity into the souls of aristocrats?”

–Colin Jones, _The Fall of Robespierre_ 146 (2021)
