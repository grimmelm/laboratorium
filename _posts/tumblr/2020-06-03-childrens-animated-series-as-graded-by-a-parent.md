- _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: The brony thing is legitimately weird, but this is legitimately a great show. The combination of epic-fantasy plots with a deep dive on friendship is a winner (and has also been deeply influential on kids’ television). It also makes the obligatory pro-social messages feel earned, rather than an afterthought. The characters are charming, the writing sparkles, and the animation is still distinctive. Endlessly watchable, which is a good thing when your kid wants to watch endlessly. Fake holidays: Nightmare Night, Hearth’s Warming Eve, Hearts and Hooves Day. Grade: **A+**

- _Avatar_: I was fifteen years too old for this when it was on TV, so I didn’t understand what the fuss was about. Now I do. It’s epic but not grandiose, funny but not dumb, and morally deep without giving into plot gravity. The world-building, the writing, the animation, the voice-acting, the fight scenes, the side characters: everything works, and everything is pulling in the same direction. (The sequel series, _The Legend of Korra_, is more of the same, with an interestingly updated setting and better music.) If your kids are like mine, they’ll want to talk about everything, and so will you. I guess binge-watching is a family thing now. Grade: **A+**

- _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_: This show is so gay. However gay you expect it to be, it’s ten times gayer. It’s also pro-diversity along every axis you can imagine, including body-type. It’s completely awesome. It captures the uncannily compelling techno-fantasy atmosphere of the original, and it has characters with the same names, but otherwise it’s a total gut rehab. The character studies at its core are compelling, even as the overall plot and action hold a young child’s interest. It takes lots of anime animation tropes and tones them down to the verge of naturalism, which I wouldn’t have thought would work, but totally does. Grade: **A-**

- _Wild Kratts_: The big kid was learning biology from this show almost from before she could talk. “Giraffe. Long neck. Eat leaves.” The premise of the show is genius: animated versions of veteran kids’ wildlife-show hosts Chris and Martin Kratt have suits that give them “creature powers,” and they travel around the world having adventures with animals. The science is legit and it’s presented entertainingly. And the characters are winners, especially the creature-suit inventor Aviva Corcovado and the colorful villains. The only thing consistently annoying about this show is that it can be shouty. Everyone is Just! So! Excited! About! Animals! Grade: **A-**.

- _Phineas and Ferb_: The _Arrested Development_ of kids’ animation, _Phineas and Ferb_ is impossibly dense with overlapping plots, brick jokes, and a large army of recurring minor characters. Every episode features an original song, some of which are genuinely brilliant (“Squirrels in My Pants” is a household favorite). It is also a wholly, completely sweet-hearted show. Even the antagonists – Candace and Dr. Doofenshmirtz – are sympathetic, charming, fully-realized, and allowed to grow and be happy in ways that a lesser version of this show would never even have realized was a possibility. The _allegretto_ pacing and intricate writing keep the show consistently fresh. New Disney at its best. Grade: **A-**

- _Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom_: From the same team who brought you _Peppa Pig_, but even drier underneath its treacly trappings. The comedic timing is straight out of classic British sketch comedy. The voice actors are clearly in on the joke, which if anything makes the show more fun to listen to than to watch. **B+**

- _Dinosaur Train_: Sometimes high concepts work. The show 100% owns its message: dinosaur physiology is a diversity metaphor, presented with just the right degree of insistence. The characters are sketched with grace and sympathy, and the science is pitched just right for its target audience. Over the years, the show (like all railfans) has gotten increasingly obsessed with its train equipment: the aquacar, the submarine, the … zeppelin. The songs are surprisingly catchy, too: our favorite is probably the Dinosaur Train Zeppelin song, which, yes, is a Led Zeppelin pastiche. Grade: **B+**

- _Odd Squad_: This one really grew on me. If all you’ve seen is short clips, it just seems like everyone is shouting about math all the time. But the show overall is delightfully goofy, with a real sense of how to string along a running gag, and some genuinely talented child actors. Grade: **B+**

- _Creative Galaxy_: Despite being a total _Daniel Tiger_ rip-off, down to the animation style, the obligatory song in every episode, and the live-action codas, this one is actually kind of nice. The art projects are well-chosen both to interest kids and also to actually be doable. Fake holidays: Heart Day. Grade: **B**

- _Peppa Pig_: It took me a long time to appreciate this show’s arch sense of humor. Everyone’s pretensions and ambitions are punctured; embarrassing mistakes and small indignities await adults at every turn. Once you realize that the show is making fun of most of its characters but loves them anyway, it’s much more bearable. Grade: **B**

- _Curious George_: Entirely forgettable, with two mildly redeeming qualities. George himself is as charming as always, and the jazzy musical score is pleasant. Grade: **B-**

- _Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir_: It took me a while to understand what this show was doing. It’s very, very French. Grade: **C+**

- _Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood_: Even my kids recognize that Daniel Tiger is needy and whiny. The show inadvertently teaches kids what to be afraid of and how to misbehave. There is also something deeply wrong with the economy of the Neighborhood: everyone seems to have multiple jobs and the public transit system runs on magic. On the plus side, the potty song has come in handy as a reminder: when you have to go potty, stop and go right away. Fake holidays: Love Day, Snowflake Day, Dress Up Day. Grade: **C+**

- _Ready Jet Go_: I suppose there’s some science in here somewhere, I guess. Grade: **C+**

- _Tumble Leaf_: Reviewers might call this one “gentle,” by which they mean “boring.” The animation is lovely and the music is calming. But what’s the point? Grade: **C+**

- _PAW Patrol_: Unbelievably, incredibly formulaic. For example: have you noticed that they get in their trucks at exactly the same point halfway through each episode? Just Canadian enough to be noticeably off, but also rah-rah in a George W. Bush-administration kind of way. Sometimes I imagine grown-up versions of the pups. Chase regularly engages in police brutality, Rubble has a drinking problem, and Marshall has joined the alt-right. Grade: **C**

- _Nature Cat_: Nature Cat is annoying and his friends are worse. I’m not clear on what they’re supposed to be learning. And the theme song manages to be both unmemorable and an earworm. Make it stop! Grade: **C**

- _Super Why_: More like _Super Why Does This Exist_, amirite? The whole show is oddly paced: I find the story-within-a-story structure confusing and can only wonder how much of it kids actually get. Having each character deal with a different aspect of literacy leaves the show’s educational content unfocused. And the Super Letters are like the world’s lamest game of Wheel of Fortune. Plus the song is an earworm, and not in a good way. Grade: **C**

- _Sofia the First_: Empty Disney calories, this show is the _reductio ad absurdum_ of Disney’s democratization of the idea of “princess.” The plotting, the writing, and the music are technically proficient. The cel-shading effects that give 3D animation the luminosity of 2D hand drawn are lovely. The messages are perfectly innocuous. But the heart of the show is a giant gaping void. Fake holidays: Wassailia. Grade: **C**

- _Lion Guard_: More empty Disney calories, like _Sofia the First_ but with more obnoxious characters. Inexplicably real holiday: Christmas. Grade: **C-**

- _Peg + Cat_: All I can remember is that the show is inexplicably drawn on graph paper, and they have a BIG BIG PROBLEM every few seconds. When people complain about STEM, and I remember that this show exists, I have to admit that they have a point. Grade: **C-**

- _Martha Speaks_: The AV Club’s term for this kind of show is “least essential.” Even by the standards of kids’ shows, the premise makes no sense. Nobody here, human or canine, is remotely sympathetic. And the plot comes to a screeching halt every time it’s time for a new vocabulary word. Grade: **C-**

- _WordWorld_: I have so many questions about this show. If everything is made out of words, what about the ground? The sky? Windows? And what are the letters in the words made of? What is going on with the accents? And who greenlit _three_ seasons of this garbage? Grade: **D+**

- _The Adventures of Puss in Boots_: This is a weird, weird show. And not in a good way. Grade: **D+**

- _Trolls: The Beat Goes On_: Quite possibly the most misanthropic kids show currently streaming anywhere. The combination of grimdark setting and hackneyed uplifting plot tropes is somewhere between unsettling and child abuse. Poppy is a walking illustration of emotional labor; Branch has severe PTSD. The show treats both of these as laughable quirks. And I am never going to get used to the Auto-Tune. Grade: **D+**

- _Kung-Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny_: Pretty much your standard DreamWorks animation. This is not a good thing. Grade: **D**

- _If You Give a Mouse a Cookie_: The animation and voice-acting are innocuous. But building an entire show around the “if X, then Y” formula led to some disastrous choices. The show taught my big kid how to say things like, “If I see a rock, I _just have_ to bring it home with me.” It takes a special kind of kids show to affirmatively instill bad habits. Grade: **D-**

- _The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2018)_: An absolute travesty in every possible way. The remake is the direct opposite of everything the original represented: crude instead of clever, manic instead of playful, and mean instead of goofy. Grade: **F-**
