title: 'Huxley, the eminent Victorian biologist, delighted in saying that whatever
  merits his English prose style might have were due in large part to the fact that
  he had escaped the training in Latin and Greek which at that time formed the chief
  basis of English education. It may well be that whatever merits the contents of
  the present work may have are due largely to the fact that when the author went
  to law school, courses in the Conflict of Laws were, if offered, usually not taken
  by most law students. It thus came about that when he was asked (in 1919) to teach
  the subject to law students, he had not been educated in the dogma then current,
  based, as it was, largely on the theories of Story and Dicey. He thus approached
  the subject with a more open mind than might otherwise have been the case. In addition,
  what little he had learned of the subject led him to refrain from reading the treatises
  until he had studied the cases in Beale’s Cases on the Conflict of Laws, and had
  formed tentative conclusions of his own as to what the problems were and how they
  might be solved. When, after this, he consulted the treatises and law review articles,
  he found that he was obviously a heretic: it seemed to him that nearly all writers
  were obsessed with indefensible theories which neither accounted for what the courts
  were doing nor led to useful decisions if logically applied.'
