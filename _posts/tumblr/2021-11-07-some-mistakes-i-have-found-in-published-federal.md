> Applying these principles, the court [in Armstrong v. Eagle Rock Entm’t, Inc., 655 F. Supp. 2d 779, 786 (E.D. Mich. 2009)] found that Eagle Rock Entertainment’s decision to use **Louis Armstrong’s** picture on the cover liner of its DVD entitled, ‘Mahavishnu Orchestra, Live at Montreux, 1984, 1974,’ without consent was protected by the First Amendment. _Rosa & Raymond Parks Inst. for Self Development v. Target Corp._, 90 F. Supp. 3d 1256, 1264 (2015).

_Armstrong_ involved Ralphe Armstrong, not Louis Armstrong, who died in 1971.

> The examiner’s final rejection, repeated in his Answer on appeal to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) Board of Appeals (board), was on the grounds that claims 1 and 2 are anticipated (fully met) by, and claim 3 would have been obvious from, an article by Kalabukhova and **Mikheyew** , _Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of Ti-Mo-Ni Alloys_, Russian Metallurgy (Metally) No. 3, pages 130-133 (1970) (in the court below and hereinafter called “the Russian article”) under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103, respectively. _Titanium Metals Corp. of America v. Banner_, 778 F.2d 775, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1985)

The author’s surname is Михеев, i.e., Mikheyev, not Mikheyew. There is no letter in the Cyrillic alphabet that transliterates to “w” under any commonly used system of Romanization.

> GCC filed a trademark application for the mark GUANTANAMERA for use in connection with cigars on May, 14, 2001. When translated, “guantanamera” means “(i) the female adjectival form of GUANTANAMO, meaning having to do with or belonging to the city or province of Guantanamo, Cuba; and/or (ii) a woman from the city or province of Guantanamo, Cuba.” (Op. U.S.P.T.O. at 2.) Many people are also familiar with the Cuban folk song, Guantanamera, which was **originally recorded in 1966**. (Id. at 12-13.) _Guantanamera Cigar Co. v. Corporacion Habanos, SA_, 729 F. Supp. 2d 246, 250 (D.D.C. 2010)

The first recording of “Guantanamera” (lyrics adapted by Julián Orbón from poetry by José Martí, music by Joseíto Fernández) was probably sometime in the 1930s by Fernández. It was released in the United States in two well-known versions in 1963, one by the Weavers (from a 1955 concert) and another by Pete Seeger. All of these predate the 1966 easy-listening version by the Sandpipers.
