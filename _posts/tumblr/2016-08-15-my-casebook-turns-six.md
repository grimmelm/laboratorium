The Sixth (sixth! sixth!) Edition of my casebook [_Internet Law: Cases and Problems_](http://internetcasebook.com) is now available. I apologize for the lateness of this update; it was a busy summer.

The big news is a new section on the physical world. For years, people have been asking me when I was going to cover drones, robots, and the sharing economy. My answer had always been that these aren’t really _Internet_ legal issues, as interesting as they may be. That hasn’t changed, but this spring I realized that we can still learn from Internet law when thinking about these “real”-world legal issues. With that, the section fell into place. I don’t try to teach any substantive law. Instead, I tee up what I think are interesting policy problems in ways that connect them back to the themes of the casebook: code is law, government control, generativity, etc. It’s at the very end of the book, together with some sections I love but that have never quite felt at home anywhere else: on virtual property, defective software, and social media in litigation. They make for a new chapter I call “Beyond the Internet.”

Most of the rest of the updates are the usual shuffling required to keep up with a field that continually renders obsolete things you thought you knew. I cover the iPhone unlocking fights with new materials on compelled assistance, using CALEA as the main teaching text. I added the Data Protection Directive and _Schrems_ to beef up the E.U. materials; I added more on the limits of Section 230; I refocused the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act section on the two Ninth Circuit _Nosal_ opinions. There’s more on Bitcoin, more on filtering, and a bit more on warrant jurisdiction. There’s a bit less on the NSA, and the usual tightening up and revisions throughout. And the typefaces are even spiffier!

As before, the book is available in two formats: a $30 pay-what-you-want DRM-free [PDF download](https://www.semaphorepress.com/InternetLaw_overview.html) from Semaphore Press, and a $65.30 [perfect-bound paperback](https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Law-Problems-James-Grimmelmann/dp/1943689016/) from Amazon. This time, though, I’m happy to say that one-third of the net revenues from sales of this edition of the book will be donated to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org).
