title: While teaching Law and Literature this year, I attached very gentle, low key
  “trigger warnings” to a number of items on the syllabus, namely those dealing with
  extreme violence, rape, and some other very unpleasant situations.  I am glad I
  did this.  I told students that if they preferred to do a substitute assignment,
  I could arrange that.  Is that so unreasonable?  There were no takers, but I don’t
  see it did anyone harm or limited free speech in the classroom (or outside of it)
  to make this offer.  If anything, it may have eased speech a slight amount by noting
  it is OK to feel uncomfortable with some topics, or at least serving up that possibility
  into the realm of common knowledge.  That struck me as better and wiser than simply
  pretending we were studying the successful operation of the Coase theorem the whole
  time.
